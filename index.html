    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        I hope you enjoy looking through this website and discovering all about our school. Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a fictional school for gifted children to learn the fine arts of magic. We believe in upholding our values and that every child is valued and nurtured.
        <br>
        My aim is that every child passing through Bonnygate grows into an independent, hard-working, confident and resilient learner that has aspirations to be the very best that they can be. If you share my aims, then Hogwarts is the school for your child.
        <br>

    <h2>
        History of Hogwarts
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and Salazar Slytherin. 
        The school was established in the highlands of Scotland to educate young witches and wizards in a safe environment away from prosecution.
        Theory has it that the name was derived from a dream by Rowena which showed a warty hog leading her to a cliff by a lake.
        Since then, Hogwarts has been educating most wizarding community in the United Kingdom and surrounding areas.
        The schools actual location is hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles.
