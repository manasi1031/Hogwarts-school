                    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is a fictional school for gifted children to learn the fine arts of magic. We
                    believe in upholding our values and that every child is valued and nurtured.
                    My aim is that every child passing through Bonnygate grows into an independent, hard-working, confident and
                    resilient learner that has aspirations to be the very best that they can be. If you share my aims, then
                    Hogwarts is the school for your child.

        <p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and
                Salazar Slytherin.
                The school was established in the highlands of Scotland to educate young witches and wizards in a safe
                environment away from prosecution.
                Theory has it that the name was derived from a dream by Rowena which showed a warty hog leading her to a
                cliff by a lake.
                Since then, Hogwarts has been educating most wizarding community in the United Kingdom and surrounding
                areas.
                The schools actual location is hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles.
                <h3>Addmission & Entry</h3>
                <p>
                    Hogwarts is a co-educational and boarding secondary school, taking children from the ages of eleven
                    to eighteen.
                    Admission in Hogwarts is selective and only those children that show an affinity towards magic would
                    be selected to attend.
                    Main mode of transportation to the school is via Hogwarts Express train (fictional)that students
                    taken from platform 9 3/4 at KIngs Cross, London.
                    Students board the train there and then get down in Hogsmeade station near Hogwarts.
                    There they are met by Hagrid - Keeper of Keys, Game and Grounds; who then takes the kids via boat /
                    carriages to school.
                    This is the same process for collecting students back from London too.
