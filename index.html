                <hr>
                <p>
                    Hogwarts was founded in the 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff and
                    Salazar Slytherin.
                    The school was established in the highlands of Scotland to educate young witches and wizards in a safe
                    environment away from prosecution.
                    Theory has it that the name was derived from a dream by Rowena which showed a warty hog leading her to a
                    cliff by a lake.
                    Since then, Hogwarts has been educating most wizarding community in the United Kingdom and surrounding
                    areas.
                    The schools actual location is hidden from other wizarding schools and muggles.

                <p>
                    Hogwarts is a co-educational and boarding secondary school, taking children from the ages of eleven
                    to eighteen.
                    Admission in Hogwarts is selective and only those children that show an affinity towards magic would
                    be selected to attend.
                    Main mode of transportation to the school is via Hogwarts Express train (fictional)that students
                    taken from platform 9 3/4 at KIngs Cross, London.
                    Students board the train there and then get down in Hogsmeade station near Hogwarts.
                    There they are met by Hagrid - Keeper of Keys, Game and Grounds; who then takes the kids via boat /
                    carriages to school.
                    This is the same process for collecting students back from London too.

                <h2>Hogwarts Houses</h2> 
                <p>
                    Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder: Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the school year, the houses compete for the House Cup and Quidditch Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great Hall for the following school year. Houses at Hogwarts are living and learning communities for their students. The dormitory and common room of a House are, barring rare exceptions, inaccessible to students belonging to other Houses.
