# Milestone Project 1
---------
# Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

![Mockup Image](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/mockup.jpg)

## Purpose
---
This site has been designed with my understanding of HTML, CSS and User centric Design modules. This is the first milestone project in my academic schedule with the Code Institute.

## Information about project: 
---
I am a crazy Harry Potter fan and I love reading and watching all their movies. I am basing my project on a fictional world and also adding in the factor of the coronavirus situation. Hogwarts cannot use OWL post or let parents come and see the school. 

This is why I ascertained the need of creating a website where parents and children and see the information regarding school’s history (for muggles or non-wizarding folk), the school houses and also know more about the actual school. They can also have a look at the images of the school for them to know that this is a safe place for the kids to be. 
In the future I will look at adding more features to the site as well to enhance the look and feel and to have a magical experience.

Enjoy the magical journey!

### Structure of the website
---

#### Design

The website is designed to be easy and user-friendy on all type of devices. On desktop, tablet or mobile device there should be no difference for a user to have a fantastic experience. All parts are designed to achieve maximum user satisfaction. User will get some interaction from the interface as links, attachments and button will have a hover effect. 

#### Typography

The below 2 font families have been used for my website mainly:
- Headings- font-family: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;
- Body- font-family: 'Cantarell', sans-serif;

#### Color scheme

I used the palette maker from the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/image-picker) website based on the logo image of school. 

Colors chosen are either direct colors or in the palette shades to give a better effect as below:
- Headings color: #A40002
- Page background color: #EEDB7A
- Body font color for paragraphs elements: #0F0C00
- Border color for components #751800
- Hover links border color #67003E
- Background for Submit button Hover #E22B60

### Testing 
--------

#### Functionality Testing:

I used Google Chrome DevTools to check the responsiveness of the web page on different devices and rectified problems accordingly.

#### Compatibility testing:

Site was tested in various devices on the Google chrome DevTools, however apart from this, physically checked in Moto G4, Redmi Note 5 Pro, Ipad Air, Ipad Air2 and Iphone 11 for different software's.

#### User Testing Stories:

- I have created a main home page and have information stored structurally in order of home page where welcome note from Deputy Headmistress is there along with history of school and the newsletter. This covers the below user story:

    _“I want to ascertain the purpose of the website and learn more about the school.”_

- There are navigational links for the other pages and I have made maximum 3 pages for ease of use. This remains constant for all devices. This covers the below 2 user stories:
    
    _“I want to be able to easily navigate through the website.”_

    _“I want to easily access relevant information.”_

- The site has been made responsive to be viewed on laptop, tablets and mobiles. This covers the below user story:

    _“I want to be able to access the site from all device types.”_

- I have created a contact us form section for any questions or general enquiries that parents may have and that have not been covered yet. The school is magical and does not have any phones. Also the school is hidden and hence the exact location of school also is not shared. People can only contact via the contact us form currently or OWL post. This covers the below user story:

    _“I want to be able to contact the school with questions that I might have.”_

- The school can be accessed via social media like Instagram, Facebook, You Tube and Twitter. There are links to this on each page as well. This covers the below user story:

    _"I want to be able to access the social media links of the school."_

- There is a separate tab on the home page which highlights any school newsletters that are announced during school year for parent information. This can also be downloaded as a pdf format and can be used by Parents at their convenience. This covers the below user story:

    _“I want to see any updated newsletters during school year.”_


#### Code Validation:

At the and of the project I used two websites to validate the codes:
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS.
- [W3C Html Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML.

Note: No errors were received.

#### Issues found during deployment:

As this was my first project, I have been rectifying changes as I see, however, there were 3 crucial issues that I had to work with.

- _Logo and header responsiveness for mobile_

![Logo CSS error on mobile](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/logo-css-small-mobile.jpg)

- I had the same issue with the responsiveness for the mobiles, as I had originally planned for max widths of 1200px, 950px and 600px respectively. This made an issue with the smaller widths of 300-450px as they did not view well on the mobiles.
- To avoid this situation and with guidance from my mentor, I changed the max-widths to 1200px, 950px, 750px, 600px and 450px.
- Once I implemented the changes the views changed dramatically overall. However, this error was the stepping stone for this major change.
- The code for this scenario changed as below:
    - Max-width: 450px - font-size: 90%
    - Max-width: 600px - height: 75px and margin: 10px 0 10px 0
    - Max-width: 750px - font-size: 130% and height: 130px
    - Max-width: 950px - font-size: 160%, line-height: 40px and height: 140px
    - Max-width: 1200px - font-size: 180% and margin-right: 0

This has changed the look as shown on the mockup and has become responsive.

- _Home page welcome note issue on the hero-image_

![text Cover Error](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/text-cover-error.jpg)

I then added the following CSS rules as below:
- Max-width: 450px for #cover-text with left: 10% and width: 250px;
- Max-width: 750px for #cover-text with left: 20% and transform: translate(0, -30%)
- Max-width: 950px for #cover-text with font-size: 80%, height: 220px, left: 30% and transform: translate(-10%, -30%);

This has changed the look as shown on the mockup and has become responsive.

- _Gallery Page_

![Old Gallery view](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/oldgalleryview.jpg)

Unfortunately, I did not take an image of the initial version of the Gallery page so I have attached the last bug that I currently had. The initial page had images all spread around the page and not aligned. I then tried to use the Masonary style from the Love Running project, but that too did not work out for me.

Finally, I referred to the W3schools gallery responsive section and used this as the basis of my code. I split the gallery into 3 sections until 1201px and post this I split the gallery into 2 for ipad and finally for mobile only 1 section. This was possible by using the div.gallery img width: 100% & height: 435px to begin with and then this fell into place with the further responsiveness.

![New Gallery view](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/newgalleryview.jpg)

- _Contact Us Page_

![Old Contact Us view](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/old-contactus-view.jpg)

I had to change the #contactus-cover to width: 95%, height: auto, top: 300px. Also the #contactus-image had to amend to max-width: 100%; opacity: .8; and background-size: cover. The backgaround image was changed and also moved from #contactus-cover to #contactus-image. 

![New Contact Us view](https://github.com/manasi1031/Hogwarts-school/blob/master/assets/images/new-contactus-view.jpg)


#### Performance Testing:

I used [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool for testing the performance of my website.

### Credits
-----

#### Content

- The text for the Hogwarts school website was copied from the Wikipedia article - [Hogwarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts#:~:text=Hogwarts%20School%20of%20Witchcraft%20and%20Wizardry%20%28%2F%20%CB%88h%C9%92%C9%A1w%C9%94%CB%90rts,a%20major%20setting%20in%20the%20Wizarding%20World%20universe.)

- The hero-image zoom css style is taken from the love running video from Code Institute. Though I have amended this further to my usage.

- To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [Gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

- I have worked on this project following a step-by-step approach from the Love running project from Code Institute to avoid missing any steps.

- The gallery responsive code is taken from w3schools CSS – [Gallery Responsive section](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_image_gallery_responsive) and then further modified to fit the page. My Mentor did suggest to use bootstrap, however, I want to just stick to HTML and CSS.

- In general, I used the knowledge and reference of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to guide me and learn more.
