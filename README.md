# Milestone Project 1
---------
# Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

Insert landing page image

## Purpose
---
This site has been designed with my understanding of HTML, CSS and User centric Design modules. This is the first milestone project in my academic schedule with the Code Institute.

## Information about project: 
---
I am a crazy Harry Potter fan and I love reading and watching all their movies. I am basing my project on a fictional world and also adding in the factor of the coronavirus situation. Hogwarts cannot use OWL post or let parents come and see the school. 

This is why I ascertained the need of creating a website where parents and children and see the information regarding school’s history (for muggles or non-wizarding folk), the school houses and also know more about the actual school. They can also have a look at the images of the school for them to know that this is a safe place for the kids to be. 
In the future I will look at adding more features to the site as well to enhance the look and feel and to have a magical experience.

Enjoy the magical journey!

### Credits
-----

#### Content

- The text for the Hogwarts school website was copied from the Wikipedia article - [Hogwarts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts#:~:text=Hogwarts%20School%20of%20Witchcraft%20and%20Wizardry%20%28%2F%20%CB%88h%C9%92%C9%A1w%C9%94%CB%90rts,a%20major%20setting%20in%20the%20Wizarding%20World%20universe.)

- The hero-image zoom css style is taken from the love running video from Code Institute. Though I have amended this further to my usage.

- To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [Gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

- I have worked on this project following a step-by-step approach from the Love running project from Code Institute to avoid missing any steps.

- The gallery responsive code is taken from w3schools CSS – [Gallery Responsive section](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_image_gallery_responsive) and then further modified to fit the page. My Mentor did suggest to use bootstrap, however, I want to just stick to HTML and CSS.

- In general I used the knowledge and reference of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) to guide me.
